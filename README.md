## Description
This application creates an employee database in mysql by using inquirer command line prompts allowing the user to enter in their employees.  The user can choose from prompts to view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, update an employee role, or exit the app.

I learned about mysql in creating this application.
